  abstract = {TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.},

For the lifetime assessment of structures in aggressive environments and earthquake-prone regions, the effects of corrosion on seismic performance need to be taken into consideration. Whereas the seismic demand depends on the results of seismic hazard assessment, the deterioration of seismic capacity depends on the environmental hazard assessment. The analysis of the life-cycle reliability of corroded reinforced concrete (RC) structures under earthquake excitations is the topic of this paper. It includes (a) estimation of the seismic capacity of corroded RC components; (b) seismic and airborne chloride hazard assessment and (c) life-cycle seismic reliability of bridges with corrosion damage. In particular, this paper introduces the visualisation of corrosion process in RC members using X-ray for modelling the spatial variability of rebar corrosion. A novel computational procedure to integrate the probabilistic hazard associated with airborne chlorides into life-cycle seismic reliability of bridge piers is presented.},

Many structures and infrastructures were severely damaged or washed away. Because tsunami effects have not been taken into consideration in the seismic design and retrofit specifications in Japan, code provisions regarding tsunamis need to be established based on the failure mechanisms observed in the tsunami-induced damage to bridges. In this paper, using both analytical fragility curves and tsunami hazard curves, the basic procedure to estimate the failure probability associated with tsunami hazard is presented. The tsunami fragility of a concrete girder bridge is estimated based on Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). Seismic reliability of a bridge is compared with tsunami reliability of the same bridge. The need to consider the tsunami effect in the design of concrete girder bridge is discussed in an illustrative example.},

The results of the cyclic tests of two seven-story one-quarter scale coupled walls tested in New Zealand are used for model validation. Except for the coupling beams, the specimens were identical. One of the specimens (Wall A) had a conventional arrangement of reinforcement in the coupling beams, whereas the other (Wall B) had beams with diagonal bars. Specimen Wall A showed lateral force–displacement response degradation after reaching a 1.6\% roof drift ratio. The degradation in specimen Wall A was due to sliding shear of the beams. Specimen Wall B exhibited stable hysteretic response throughout the test. The authors use two kinds of Beam-Truss Models and compare computed and measured key responses in these tests. Computed responses, measured and not measured in the tests, are also compared with the results of Nonlinear Truss Models reported in the literature. This paper shows that the relatively simple and computational-efficient Beam-Truss Models predicted well important aspects of the response, such as the lateral force–displacement envelope, the sliding shear of the coupling beams in specimen Wall A and the ductile behavior of specimen Wall B.},

It is shown that the presence of a structure on top of an outcropping fault may have a significant influence on the rupture path: with heavy structures founded on continuous and rigid foundations, the fault rupture diverts substantially and may avoid rupturing underneath the structure. The latter undergoes rigid body rotation, with its foundation sometimes loosing contact with the bearing soil, but in most cases retaining its structural integrity. In stark contrast, buildings on isolated footings and, perhaps surprisingly, piles exert a smaller diversion of the rupture which is thus likely to outcrop between the footings or pile caps; the latter may thus undergo devastating differential displacements. It is shown that structures in the vicinity of faults can be designed to survive significant dislocations. The “secret” of successful performance lies on the continuity, stiffness, and rigidity of the foundation.},

This paper: (i) Describes three different finite element (FE) methods of analysis, that were developed to simulate dip slip fault rupture propagation through soil and its interaction with foundation–structure systems; (ii) Validates the developed FE methodologies against centrifuge model tests that were conducted at the University of Dundee, Scotland; and (iii) Utilises one of these analysis methods to conduct a short parametric study on the interaction of idealised 2- and 5-story residential structures lying on slab foundations subjected to normal fault rupture. The comparison between numerical and centrifuge model test results shows that reliable predictions can be achieved with reasonably sophisticated constitutive soil models that take account of soil softening after failure. A prerequisite is an adequately refined FE mesh, combined with interface elements with tension cut-off between the soil and the structure. The results of the parametric study reveal that the increase of the surcharge load q of the structure leads to larger fault rupture diversion and “smoothing” of the settlement profile, allowing reduction of its stressing. Soil compliance is shown to be beneficial to the stressing of a structure. For a given soil depth H and imposed dislocation h, the rotation Δθ of the structure is shown to be a function of: (a) its location relative to the fault rupture; (b) the surcharge load q; and (c) soil compliance.},

  abstract = {The experience of past earthquakes has revealed that highway and railway elements are quite vulnerable to earthquake shaking and induced phenomena such as soil liquefaction or landslide; damages to these elements can seriously affect the transportation of products and people in both short-term (emergency actions) and long-term period. The objective of this chapter is to propose appropriate fragility functions for roadway and railway components other than bridges that are presented separately in Chap. 9. To this end, the main typological features are summarized and a short review of earthquake damages together with damage states definitions are provided for these elements. Fragility curves from literature are collected and reviewed. In some cases these functions are modified and adapted, while in other cases new fragility curves are developed. A general procedure for the derivation of analytical fragility curves that was followed in SYNER-G is described. This approach takes into account the effect of structure geometry, ground motion characteristics, soil conditions and associated uncertainties. New fragility curves are presented for tunnels in soil, embankments, cuttings and bridge abutments based on numerical analyses due to ground shaking. Finally, the proposed fragility functions are summarized and a general scheme to identify the functionality of roadway and railway elements due to different damage levels is outlined.},

  abstract = {A procedure to account for the uncertainty in the characteristics of future ground motions during seismic response assessment is presented. In the proposed procedure, the probability of exceedance of structural response parameters conditioned to a given ground motion intensity is computed from a series of deterministic response history analyses at three loading intensity levels. The proposed procedure explicitly takes into account the variation of dispersion of the structural response with changes in the loading intensity. Regression analyses are conducted on the parameters of the conditional probability distribution in order to estimate the conditional probability of exceedance at other ground motion intensity levels. Results are then combined with probabilistic estimates of seismic loading in order to estimate the mean annual rates of exceedance of various structural response parameters. The proposed procedure is evaluated when applied to an existing seven-story reinforced concrete building. Results are also compared to those obtained with an existing simplified procedure. The effect of various simplifying assumptions made in the existing simplified solution are also evaluated. It is shown that neglecting variations in dispersion in some cases can lead to significant errors. It is concluded that the proposed procedure provides more accurate results than the simplified approach with only a minimum additional computational effort.},

  abstract = {Tsunamis are rare destructive phenomena caused by the sudden displacement of a large amount of water in the ocean and can result in enormous losses to coastal communities. The resilience of coastal communities to tsunamis can be improved through the use of risk-informed decision making tools. Performance-Based Engineering (PBE) approaches have been developed for different natural hazards including earthquake, fire, hurricane, and wind to perform probabilistic risk assessment for structures. In this study, a probabilistic Performance-Based Tsunami Engineering (PBTE) framework based on the total probability theorem is proposed for the risk assessment of structures subject to tsunamis. The proposed framework can be disaggregated into the different basic analysis phases of hazard analysis, foundation and structure characterization, interaction analysis, structural analysis, damage analysis, and loss analysis. An application example consisting of the risk assessment of a three-story steel moment frame structure was performed using the proposed framework. The probability of exceedance of the total replacement cost including structural, nonstructural, and content losses were computed.},

The approach improves an earlier algorithm by Jayaram et al. [2011]. Key steps in the process are to screen a ground motion database for suitable motions, statistically simulate response spectra from a target distribution, find motions whose spectra match each statistically simulated response spectrum, and then perform an optimization to further improve the consistency of the selected motions with the target distribution. These steps are discussed in detail, and the computational expense of the algorithm is evaluated. A brief example selection exercise is performed, to illustrate the type of results that can be obtained. Source code for the algorithm has been provided, along with metadata for several popular databases of recorded and simulated ground motions, which should facilitate a variety of exploratory and research studies.},

  abstract = {Past hurricanes in the United States have highlighted the structural vulnerability of bridges exposed to storm surge and wave loads, triggering the development of fragility models. These models are essential for estimating the likelihood of structural failures in bridges during extreme events to support risk mitigation and resilience enhancement. However, the literature still lacks fragility models that can accommodate the effects of spatial variability of surge and wave loads and bridge characteristics like superstructure type and span slope. In addition, the presence of different types of superstructure within the same bridge necessitates the development of fragility models which can handle such variations. In this light, first, this study develops fragility models for individual spans of different bridge classes (concrete girder, steel girder, slab, box girder) considering spatial variability of wave loads and variations in structural characteristics. Herein, nonlinear dynamic analyses are employed for calculating the structural response and stepwise logistic regression is used for deriving the predictive fragility models. Then, a bridge system fragility assessment framework is proposed for system reliability assessment of the entire bridge, which accounts for different types of superstructures within the bridge and partially correlated span failures. In order to demonstrate the application of the fragility models and the system fragility assessment framework for regional level risk mitigation, the performance of bridges in the Houston-Galveston region is evaluated for two storm scenarios. The results show that the system failure probability obtained using no correlated span failure assumption is close to the actual failure probability obtained using the proposed approach highlighting the effects of correlations (or the lack of) on the system fragility.},

The performance is expressed in terms of the probability—conditional on the wind event intensity—that the fraction of the building occupants on one floor that perceive the motion is greater than a chosen threshold value. The framework is fully probabilistic, and numerous uncertainties affecting both the structural response and the human perception threshold are considered in the assessment of the exceedance probability. In addition, a new database-enabled online analysis module based on the proposed PBD framework [Performance-Based Data-Enabled Design module for Occupant Comfort (PBDED-OC)] is presented. The PBDED-OC allows the assessment of the occupant comfort performance of a tall building by taking advantage of databases of high-frequency base balance measurements or by adopting specific user-supplied wind tunnel data and is envisaged to be particularly useful during the preliminary design phase.},

  abstract = {In contrast to approaches based on scaling of recorded seismograms, using extensive inventories of numerically simulated earthquakes avoids the need for any selection and scaling of motions which implicitly requires assumptions on intensity measures (IMs) that correlate with structural response. This study has the objectives to examine seismogram features that control the collapse response of tall buildings and to develop efficient and reliable collapse classification algorithms. To that end, machine learning techniques are applied to the results of nonlinear response history analyses of a 20-story tall building performed using about two million simulated ground motions. Feature selection of ground motion IMs generally confirms current understanding of collapse predictors based on previous studies using scaled recorded motions. In addition, interrogations of the large collection of hazard-consistent simulations demonstrate the utility of different IMs for collapse risk assessment in a way that is not possible with recorded motions. Finally, a small subset of IMs is identified and used in development of an efficient collapse classification algorithm which is tested on benchmark simulated data at several sites in the Los Angeles basin.},

Three case study locations (Miami-Dade County, FL; New Hanover County, NC and Galveston County, TX) are presented for two types of analyses: annual regional loss estimation and event-based regional loss estimation. Demographic information, such as median house value and changes in house numbers, and distribution of houses for different exposures, is used to estimate the time-dependent probability of damage with or without possible climate change-induced change in wind speed, frequency and/or surge height. Through both analyses, it was found that climate change may have a significant impact on regional hurricane damage losses.},

This paper examines uncertainty consideration in input ground-motion and numerical seismic response analyses as part of PBEE, with particular attention given to the physical consistency and completeness of uncertainty consideration. It is argued that the use of the commonly adopted incremental dynamic analysis leads to a biased representation of the seismic intensity and that when considering the number of ground motions to be used in seismic response analyses, attention should be given to both reducing parameter estimation uncertainty and also limiting ground-motion selection bias. Research into uncertainties in system-specific numerical seismic response analysis models to date has been largely restricted to the consideration of `low-level' constitutive model parameter uncertainties. However, `high-level' constitutive model and model methodology uncertainties are likely significant and therefore represent a key research area in the coming years. It is also argued that the common omission of high-level seismic response analysis modelling uncertainties leads to a fallacy that ground-motion uncertainty is more significant than numerical modelling uncertainty. The author's opinion of the role of uncertainty analysis in PBEE is also presented.},

The construct of a ground motion simulation validation matrix is developed for assessing the appropriateness of a particular suite of simulated ground motions from the perspective of region-to-site-specific application and for different specific engineering systems. Appropriate validation metrics and “pass” criteria, the consideration of modeling uncertainties, and limitations associated with a relative lack of validation data are also addressed. An example is utilized in order to demonstrate the application of the guidance. This document is intended to be bidirectional in the sense that it provides guidance for earthquake engineers on the appropriateness of a suite of ground motion simulations for utilization in a site-specific context, as well as ground motion simulators to understand the context in which their results will be utilized.},

  abstract = {Earthquake fault ruptures may emerge at the ground surface causing large differential movements. When fault ruptures emerge at or adjacent to the position of existing foundations, significant damage can be caused. However, the study of recent faulting events revealed that in some circumstances the fault-rupture emergence is deflected by the presence of buildings leaving the buildings intact. A centrifuge modelling study has been conducted to investigate how normal faults interact with strip foundations which run parallel to the strike direction. The study confirms that fault rupture may be deviated by the presence of the foundation so that the foundation is protected from the most serious differential movements. However, whilst the fault propagates to the soil surface the foundation has to withstand initial movements before the final fault rupture emergence mechanism is activated. The centrifuge results suggest that it is the bearing pressure of the foundation which causes the deviation of the fault rather than the kinematic restraint of the foundation. The interaction between the earthquake fault and the shallow foundation depends on the foundation bearing pressure, foundation width, soil depth and position of the fault relative to the foundation and these aspects should be considered in design. Results from the tests are used to validate a series of finite element analyses as reported in an accompanying paper.},

  abstract = {The propagation of reverse faults through soil to the ground surface has been observed to cause damage to surface infrastructure. However, the interaction between a fault propagating through a sand layer and a shallow foundation can be beneficial for heavily loaded foundations by causing deviation of the fault away from the foundation. This was studied in a series of centrifuge model tests in which reverse faults of dip angle 60° (at bedrock level) were initiated through a sand layer, close to shallow foundations. The tests revealed subtle interaction between the fault and the shallow foundation so that the foundation and soil response depend on the foundation loading, position, breadth and flexibility. Heavily loaded rigid foundations appeared best able to deviate fault rupture away from the foundation but this deviation could be associated with significant foundation rotations. However, a lightly loaded foundation was unable to deviate a reverse fault and the fault emerged beneath the foundation. This led to gapping beneath the foundation as well as significant rotations and may cause severe structural distress. As well as providing insight into the mechanisms of behaviour, the data from the tests is used to validate finite element analyses in a separate article.},

The underlying seismic analysis procedure has been validated against observed performance of landfills shaken by the 1989 Loma Prieta and 1994 Northridge, California earthquakes. The procedure is comprehensive in that it requires: (i) characterization of the design bedrock motions in terms of intensity, frequency content, and duration; (ii) estimation of the seismic loading at the base and cover of the landfill; (iii) e valuation of performance in terms of seismically induced permanent deformations; and (iv) appropriate engineering judgment.},

A comprehensive overview of all research and points of view on these broad topics is beyond the scope of this paper. Rather, the objective is to provide selected examples to illustrate the nature of the issues and possible solutions, with the understanding that multihazard design is a relatively new endeavor and that the accomplishments in this field for the most part lie ahead. Topics covered include description of the political context that led to multihazard design, review of current return periods and safety indices for various hazards in model design codes, issues related to hazard interaction and cascading effects, considerations for interdependent systems, and structural element optimization to provide multihazard resistance.},

Although many simulation models are available for the individual effects of earthquake and tsunami hazards on bridges, there are limited modeling approaches for predicting damage from sequential earthquake and tsunami hazards. A bridge modeling approach, which includes soil–foundation–structure interaction effects, is developed within the finite-element framework OpenSees to quantify sequential earthquake and tsunami-induced damage. Multihazard interaction diagrams that relate earthquake and tsunami intensity measures to bridge system damage show that the residual effects of earthquake loading on the bridge system reduce resistance to subsequent tsunami loading.},

  abstract = {The uniaxial Giuffrè-Menegotto-Pinto (GMP) constitutive steel model is widely used in nonlinear modeling of reinforced concrete components. However, the parameters characterizing this constitutive law are not easily identifiable from mechanical tests. An extensive literature review showed that most authors use the parameter values recommended during the early development of this constitutive model. Therefore, a calibration of the model parameters to steel manufactured in accordance to modern standards represents an important contribution to researchers and engineering professionals. A series of cyclic stress-strain tests were performed on 36 reinforcing steel Grade 60 coupons. To obtain data about statistical variability, the bar specimens were sourced from three different manufacturers. The test results were used to calibrate the model parameters, which were then verified using a set of validation reversed cyclic stress-strain tests. The strain-rate effects were analyzed using equivalent cyclic coupon tests at rates of 0.001/s0.001/s{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mn{$>$}0.001{$<$}/mn{$><$}mo stretchy="false"{$>$}/{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi mathvariant="normal"{$>$}s{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} and 0.02/s0.02/s{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mn{$>$}0.02{$<$}/mn{$><$}mo stretchy="false"{$>$}/{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi mathvariant="normal"{$>$}s{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}.

  abstract = {In this paper, probabilistic drift and shear force capacity models are developed for corroding reinforced concrete (RC) columns. The developments represent a merger between a probabilistic model for chloride-induced corrosion, a time-dependent corrosion rate, and previously developed probabilistic models for drift and shear force capacity of pristine (undamaged) RC columns. Fragility estimates are obtained for an example corroding column by applying the developed models at given shear and drift demands. Model uncertainties in both the capacity and corrosion models are considered in the fragility estimation, in addition to uncertainties in environmental conditions, material properties, and structural geometry. Sensitivity analyses of the corroding RC column are carried out to identify the parameters to which the reliability of the example column is most sensitive. The developed models consider different combinations of chloride exposure condition, environmental oxygen availability, water-to-cement ratios, and curing conditions. They are applicable to both existing and new RC columns and may be employed for the prediction of service-life and life-cycle cost analysis of RC structures.},

This liquefaction resulted in substantial global (mass) settlement and lateral movement (spreading) of the fills towards the sea, which adversely affected wharf structures and buildings constructed on shallow and deep foundations. This paper presents key observations from the QuakeCoRE-GEER post-earthquake reconnaissance efforts at the CentrePort Wellington. The different materials and methods used to construct the reclaimed land at CentrePort influenced the patterns of observed liquefaction and its effects. Areas of gravel liquefaction at the port are especially important due to the limited number of these case histories in the literature. Liquefaction-induced ground deformations caused the wharves to displace laterally and damage their piles and offloading equipment. Lateral ground extension and differential settlement damaged buildings, whereas buildings in areas of uniform ground settlement without lateral extension performed significantly better.},

The structure of the database derives from the ITalian ACcelerometric Archive (ITACA Working Group in ITalian ACcelerometric Archive, version 2.1, 2016. doi:10.13127/ITACA/2.1), devoted to archive and distribute recorded strong motion data. To date, SYNTHESIS includes more than 4500 simulated accelerograms associated to earthquake scenarios of either occurred events or possible future events. The database also includes information about kinematic rupture models and propagation medium related to the synthetic waveforms. The main features of the SYNTHESIS web-portal for dissemination of synthetics are here illustrated. A wide range of key fields enables the user to interactively retrieve simulated waveforms, modeling parameters and information on simulation sites. A range of display options allows users to view data in different frameworks, to extract and download synthetic waveforms and to display maps of selected peak ground motion parameters. SYNTHESIS is a prototype designed to fulfill specific needs of two Italian projects, and developed with the aim of promoting the use of simulated waveforms for hazard analysis. Ground motion simulations can be employed in a variety of applications, such as: (1) to evaluate shaking scenarios for seismic risk mitigation; (2) to define seismic inputs for site response or structural response analyses; (3) to integrate observed data for the calibration of ground motion prediction equations and (4) to evaluate the different components of the ground motion variability.},

  abstract = {This study evaluates the performance of a new intensity measure, referred to as filtered incremental velocity FIV3, which is computed using time-domain features extracted from an acceleration time series and is aimed at the evaluation of structural collapse. This novel approach focuses on the area under a small number of acceleration pulses in the ground motion instead of focusing on the peak response of linear elastic oscillators as in many recently proposed measures of ground motion intensity. FIV3 is developed based on previous research that has highlighted the close relation between the incremental velocity of a ground motion and its potential to induce large inelastic incursions on structures. However, unlike the original definition of incremental velocity which provides a single level of intensity for a ground motion, this new intensity measure is period-dependent and computed as the sum of the three largest incremental velocities obtained from a low-pass filtered ground acceleration time series. Efficiency and sufficiency with respect to several ground motion parameters such as magnitude, source-to-site-distance, spectral shape, scale factor, and duration are carefully evaluated and compared against those computed with some traditional and recently proposed intensity measures using collapse results from a four-story reinforced concrete frame. Results indicate that FIV3 leads to lower variability of collapse estimates and therefore higher efficiency as well as high sufficiency compared with those of other ground motion intensity parameters indicating that this new intensity measure is a promising parameter for structural collapse risk assessment.},

  abstract = {With the goal to facilitate research to evaluate the risks from natural hazards and alternate risk mitigation strategies, the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure’s Computational Modeling and Simulation Center (NHERI SimCenter) is developing computational workflows for regional hazard simulations. These simulations enable research to integrate detailed assessments of individual facilities with comprehensive regional-scale simulations of natural hazard effects. This approach enables fine (parcel level) granularity on assessing natural hazard impacts on buildings, infrastructures systems and other constructed facilities, which can enable engineering informed assessment of policy considerations and socio-economic impacts. Effective development of research platforms for high-resolution regional simulations requires modular workflows that can integrate state-of-the-art models with information technologies and high-performance computing resources. In this paper, the modular architecture of the computational workflow models is described and illustrated through testbed applications to evaluate regional building damage under an earthquake and a hurricane scenario. Developed and disseminated as open-source software on the NHERI Design Safe Cyberinfrastructure, the computational models and workflows are enabling multi-disciplinary collaboration on research to mitigate the effects of natural hazard disasters.},

The model is based on 1D continuum damage mechanics and relates any 2 work-conjugate response variables such as force-displacement, moment-rotation, or stress-strain. The strength and stiffness deterioration is described by a continuous damage variable. The formulation uses a criterion based on the hysteretic energy and the maximum or minimum deformation for damage initiation with a cumulative probability distribution function for the damage evolution. A series of structural component response simulations showcase the ability of the model to describe different types of hysteretic behavior. The relation of the model's damage variable to the Park-Ang damage index is also discussed. Because of its consistent and numerically robust formulation, the model is suitable for the large-scale seismic response simulation of structural systems with strength and stiffness deterioration.},

  abstract = {Soil-structure interaction may play a major role in the seismic response of a bridge structure. Specifically, soil layers of low stiffness and strength may result in permanent displacement of the abutments and foundations, thus imposing important kinematic conditions to the bridge structure. A study to illustrate such phenomena is undertaken based on three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic finite-element (FE) modeling and analysis (for a specific bridge configuration under a given seismic excitation). A bridge-foundation-ground model is developed based on the structural configuration and local soil conditions of the Humboldt Bay Middle Channel Bridge. The FE model and nonlinear solution strategy are built in the open-source software platform OpenSees of the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center. Based on the simulation results, the overall system seismic response behavior is examined, as well as local deformations/stresses at selected critical locations. It is shown that permanent ground deformation may induce settlement and longitudinal/transversal displacements of the abutments and deep foundations. The relatively massive approach ramps may also contribute to this simulated damage condition, which imposes large stresses on the bridge foundations, supporting piers, and superstructure.},

  abstract = {With the development and implementation of performance-based earthquake engineering, harmonization of performance levels between structural and nonstructural components becomes vital. Even if the structural components of a building achieve a continuous or immediate occupancy performance level after a seismic event, failure of architectural, mechanical or electrical components can lower the performance level of the entire building system. This reduction in performance caused by the vulnerability of nonstructural components has been observed during recent earthquakes worldwide. Moreover, nonstructural damage has limited the functionality of critical facilities, such as hospitals, following major seismic events. The investment in nonstructural components and building contents is far greater than that of structural components and framing. Therefore, it is not surprising that in many past earthquakes, losses from damage to nonstructural components have exceeded losses from structural damage. Furthermore, the failure of nonstructural components can become a safety hazard or can hamper the safe movement of occupants evacuating buildings, or of rescue workers entering buildings. In comparison to structural components and systems, there is relatively limited information on the seismic design of nonstructural components. Basic research work in this area has been sparse, and the available codes and guidelines are usually, for the most part, based on past experiences, engineering judgment and intuition, rather than on objective experimental and analytical results. Often, design engineers are forced to start almost from square one after each earthquake event: to observe what went wrong and to try to prevent repetitions. This is a consequence of the empirical nature of current seismic regulations and guidelines for nonstructural components. This review paper summarizes current knowledge on the seismic design and analysis of nonstructural building components, identifying major knowledge gaps that will need to be filled by future research. Furthermore, considering recent trends in earthquake engineering, the paper explores how performance-based seismic design might be conceived for nonstructural components, drawing on recent developments made in the field of seismic design and hinting at the specific considerations required for nonstructural components.},

  abstract = {The study presented in this paper addresses the issue of engineering validation of Graves and Pitarka's (2010) hybrid broadband ground motion simulation methodology with respect to some well-recorded historical events and considering the response of multiple degrees of freedom (MDoF) systems. Herein, validation encompasses detailed assessment of how similar is, for a given event, the seismic response due to comparable hybrid broadband simulated records and real records. In the first part of this study, in order to investigate the dynamic response of a wide range of buildings, MDoF structures are modeled as elastic continuum systems consisting of a combination of a flexural cantilever beam coupled with a shear cantilever beam. A number of such continuum systems are selected including the following: (1) 16 oscillation periods between 0.1 and 6 s; (2) three shear to flexural deformation ratios to represent respectively shear-wall structures, dual systems, and moment-resisting frames; and (3) two stiffness distributions along the height of the systems, that is, uniform and linear. Demand spectra in terms of generalized maximum interstory drift ratio (IDR) and peak floor acceleration (PFA) are derived using simulations and actual recordings for four historical earthquakes, namely, the 1979 Mw 6.5 Imperial Valley earthquake, 1989 Mw 6.8 Loma Prieta earthquake, 1992 Mw 7.2 Landers earthquake, and 1994 Mw 6.7 Northridge earthquake. In the second part, for two nonlinear case study structures, the IDR and PFA distributions over the height and their statistics, are obtained and compared for both recorded and simulated time histories. These structures are steel moment frames designed for high seismic hazard, 20-story high-rise and 6-story low-rise buildings. The results from this study highlight the similarities and differences between simulated and real records in terms of median and intra-event standard deviation of logs of seismic demands for MDoF building systems. This general agreement, in a broad range of moderate and long periods, may provide confidence in the use of the simulation methodology for engineering applications, whereas the discrepancies, statistically significant only at short periods, may help in addressing improvements in generation of synthetic records.

  abstract = {We propose a robust and efficient field-aligned volumetric meshing algorithm that produces hex-dominant meshes, i.e. meshes that are predominantly composed of hexahedral elements while containing a small number of irregular polyhedra. The latter are placed according to the singularities of two optimized guiding fields, which allow our method to generate meshes with an exceptionally high amount of isotropy. The field design phase of our method relies on a compact quaternionic representation of volumetric octa-fields and a corresponding optimization that explicitly models the discrete matchings between neighboring elements. This optimization naturally supports alignment constraints and scales to very large datasets. We also propose a novel extraction technique that uses field-guided mesh simplification to convert the optimized fields into a hexdominant output mesh. Each simplification operation maintains topological validity as an invariant, ensuring manifold output. These steps easily generalize to other dimensions or representations, and we show how they can be an asset in existing 2D surface meshing techniques. Our method can automatically and robustly convert any tetrahedral mesh into an isotropic hex-dominant mesh and (with minor modifications) can also convert any triangle mesh into a corresponding isotropic quad-dominant mesh, preserving its genus, number of holes, and manifoldness. We demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm on a large collection of shapes provided in the supplemental material along with all generated results.},

To identify the best design, a holistic approach is necessary, considering emissions, energy use, direct costs, potential earthquake costs, etc. Accordingly, this paper addresses a multitude of lifecycle impacts associated with the manufacturing, construction, operations, damage, and demolition of buildings. All impacts are translated into a common utility, measured in dollars. A collection of cost models is developed, and detailed building models are created from BIM, i.e., building information modelling. A comprehensive analysis is conducted for a six-story building. Results show that the steel material option results in the lowest construction cost. The wood option results in the lowest cost of emissions, while the concrete option contributes the most to climate change. Earthquake damage accounts for about 3\% of the total expected cost, but the worst-case earthquake cost exceeds the building value.},

  abstract = {Seismic hazard modeling is a multidisciplinary science that aims to forecast earthquake occurrence and its resultant ground shaking. Such models consist of a probabilistic framework that quantifies uncertainty across a complex system; typically, this includes at least two model components developed from Earth science: seismic source and ground motion models. Although there is no scientific prescription for the forecast length, the most common probabilistic seismic hazard analyses consider forecasting windows of 30 to 50 years, which are typically an engineering demand for building code purposes. These types of analyses are the topic of this review paper. Although the core methods and assumptions of seismic hazard modeling have largely remained unchanged for more than 50 years, we review the most recent initiatives, which face the difficult task of meeting both the increasingly sophisticated demands of society and keeping pace with advances in scientific understanding. A need for more accurate and spatially precise hazard forecasting must be balanced with increased quantification of uncertainty and new challenges such as moving from time-independent hazard to forecasts that are time dependent and specific to the time period of interest. Meeting these challenges requires the development of science-driven models, which integrate all information available, the adoption of proper mathematical frameworks to quantify the different types of uncertainties in the hazard model, and the development of a proper testing phase of the model to quantify its consistency and skill. We review the state of the art of the National Seismic Hazard Modeling and how the most innovative approaches try to address future challenges.},

The study evaluates the impact of lifetime exposure to chlorides from deicing salts on the seismic performance of multispan continuous highway bridges, considering corrosion of reinforced concrete columns and steel bridge bearings. The components’ degradation and their influence on seismic response are illustrated through three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic analysis. A full probabilistic analysis accounting for variation in bridge, ground motion, and corrosion parameters is conducted to develop time-dependent seismic fragility curves. These fragility curves indicate the evolving potential for component and system damage under seismic loading considering time-dependent corrosion-induced deterioration. The results indicate that while corrosion may actually decrease the seismic vulnerability of some components, most critical components suffer an increase in vulnerability. Quadratic models depicting the change in lognormal seismic fragility parameters are proposed to capture the time-dependent effect of aging on the fragility of the bridge system. Overall, the seismic vulnerability significantly increases throughout the lifetime of the representative bridge geometry, with a 32\% shift in the median value of complete damage fragility near the end of the bridge’s life.},

Effects of structural degradation of multiple bridge components, variations in bridge geometry, and comparison of different environmental exposure conditions have traditionally been ignored in the development of seismic fragility curves for aging concrete highway bridges. This study focuses on the degradation of multiple bridge components of a geometrically varying bridge class, as opposed to a single bridge sample, to arrive at time-dependent seismic bridge fragility curves. The effects of different exposure conditions are also explored to assess the impact of severity of the environment on bridge seismic vulnerability. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on a representative class of aging multi-span reinforced concrete girder bridges typical of the Central and Southeastern United States. The results reveal the importance of considering multiple deterioration mechanisms, including the significance of degrading elastomeric bearings along with the corroding reinforced concrete columns, in fragility modeling of aging bridge classes. Additionally, assessment of the relative severity of exposure to marine atmospheric, marine sea-splash and deicing salts, and shows 5\%, 9\% and 44\% reduction, respectively, in the median value bridge fragility for the complete damage state relative to the as-built pristine structure.},

A synthesis is presented of the identified interaction relationships between these hazards, using an accessible visual format particularly suited to end users. Interactions considered are primarily those where a primary hazard triggers or increases the probability of secondary hazards occurring. In this paper we do the following: (i) identify, through a wide-ranging review of grey- and peer-review literature, 90 interactions; (ii) subdivide the interactions into three levels, based on how well we can characterize secondary hazards, given information about the primary hazard; (iii) determine the spatial overlap and temporal likelihood of the triggering relationships occurring; and (iv) examine the relationship between primary and secondary hazard intensities for each identified hazard interaction and group these into five possible categories. In this study we have synthesized, using accessible visualization techniques, large amounts of information drawn from many scientific disciplines. We outline the importance of constraining hazard interactions and reinforce the importance of a holistic (or multihazard) approach to natural hazard assessment. This approach allows those undertaking research into single hazards to place their work within the context of other hazards. It also communicates important aspects of hazard interactions, facilitating an effective analysis by those working on reducing and managing disaster risk within both the policy and practitioner communities.},

  abstract = {Robust estimation of collapse risk should consider the uncertainty in modeling of structures as well as variability in earthquake ground motions. In this paper, we illustrate incorporation of the uncertainty in structural model parameters in nonlinear dynamic analyses to probabilistically assess story drifts and collapse risk of buildings. Monte Carlo simulations with Latin hypercube sampling are performed on ductile and non-ductile reinforced concrete building archetypes to quantify the influence of modeling uncertainties and how it is affected by the ductility and collapse modes of the structures. Inclusion of modeling uncertainty is shown to increase the mean annual frequency of collapse by approximately 1.8 times, as compared with analyses neglecting modeling uncertainty, for a high-seismic site. Modeling uncertainty has a smaller effect on drift demands at levels usually considered in building codes; for the same buildings, modeling uncertainty increases the mean annual frequency of exceeding story drift ratios of 0.03 by 1.2 times. A novel method is introduced to relate drift demands at maximum considered earthquake intensities to collapse safety through a joint distribution of deformation demand and capacity. This framework enables linking seismic performance goals specified in building codes to drift limits and other acceptance criteria. The distributions of drift demand at maximum considered earthquake and capacity of selected archetype structures enable comparisons with the proposed seismic criteria for the next edition (2016) of ASCE 7. Subject to the scope of our study, the proposed drift limits are found to be unconservative, relative to the target collapse safety in ASCE 7. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Regional-scale coseismic landslide hazard assessments have traditionally been based on infinite-slope analyses, considering only a single mode of failure. Inventories and landslide reconnaissance work have shown a diverse range of coseismic landslide modes with significantly different consequences of failure. This paper presents a multimodal approach for regional-scale coseismic landslide hazard assessment. Through a two-step procedure, the multimodal method explicitly accounts for four general landslide types commonly observed during earthquakes: rock-slope failures, disrupted soil slides, coherent rotational slides, and lateral spreads. First, the susceptibility to each landslide mode is evaluated based on topography. Second, coseismic landslide hazards are assessed using mode-specific geotechnical models. A trial multimodal landslide assessment is presented for the seismically active country of Lebanon. Results show that the computed coseismic landslide hazard closely matches field-verified slope activity across different regions of the country exhibiting a range of failure modes. These results qualitatively demonstrate the efficacy of the procedure and suggest that multimodal coseismic landslide hazard analysis is especially well-suited for regions with varying terrain and where landslide inventories are not available.}

  abstract = {CyberShake, as part of the Southern California Earthquake Center's (SCEC) Community Modeling Environment, is developing a methodology that explicitly incorporates deterministic source and wave propagation effects within seismic hazard calculations through the use of physics-based 3D ground motion simulations. To calculate a waveform-based seismic hazard estimate for a site of interest, we begin with Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, Version 2.0 (UCERF2.0) and identify all ruptures within 200~km of the site of interest. We convert the UCERF2.0 rupture definition into multiple rupture variations with differing hypocenter locations and slip distributions, resulting in about 415,000 rupture variations per site. Strain Green Tensors are calculated for the site of interest using the SCEC Community Velocity Model, Version 4 (CVM4), and then, using reciprocity, we calculate synthetic seismograms for each rupture variation. Peak intensity measures are then extracted from these synthetics and combined with the original rupture probabilities to produce probabilistic seismic hazard curves for the site. Being explicitly site-based, CyberShake directly samples the ground motion variability at that site over many earthquake cycles (i.e., rupture scenarios) and alleviates the need for the ergodic assumption that is implicitly included in traditional empirically based calculations. Thus far, we have simulated ruptures at over 200 sites in the Los Angeles region for ground shaking periods of 2s and longer, providing the basis for the first generation CyberShake hazard maps. Our results indicate that the combination of rupture directivity and basin response effects can lead to an increase in the hazard level for some sites, relative to that given by a conventional Ground Motion Prediction Equation (GMPE). Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, we find that the physics-based hazard results are much more sensitive to the assumed magnitude-area relations and magnitude uncertainty estimates used in the definition of the ruptures than is found in the traditional GMPE approach. This reinforces the need for continued development of a better understanding of earthquake source characterization and the constitutive relations that govern the earthquake rupture process.},

  abstract = {An end-to-end computational platform is presented, which automates seismic design, nonlinear structural model construction, and response simulation (static and dynamic) of steel moment resisting frames. A modular framework is adopted along with the object-oriented programming paradigm to ensure the adaptability of the platform. The seismic design module iteratively generates code-conforming section sizes and detailing for beams, columns, and beam-column connections based on the relevant input design variables including the building configuration (e.g., the number of stories, the number of lateral-force resisting systems, and the building dimensions), loads (e.g., dead and live loads on each floor), and site conditions (mapped spectral acceleration parameters). The nonlinear model construction and analysis module takes the design results as input and produces structural models that capture flexural strength and stiffness deterioration in the frame beam-column elements, and performs pushover and response history analyses. Illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of the platform, which significantly reduces the time and effort involved in producing iterative structural designs and conducting nonlinear analyses, both of which are necessary for performance-based seismic design. Additionally, the platform can be used to create an extensive database of archetype steel moment frame buildings towards the development of analytics-driven design methods.},

  abstract = {Coastal flood damage and adaptation costs under 21st century sea-level rise are assessed on a global scale taking into account a wide range of uncertainties in continental topography data, population data, protection strategies, socioeconomic development and sea-level rise. Uncertainty in global mean and regional sea level was derived from four different climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, each combined with three land-ice scenarios based on the published range of contributions from ice sheets and glaciers. Without adaptation, 0.2–4.6\% of global population is expected to be flooded annually in 2100 under 25–123 cm of global mean sea-level rise, with expected annual losses of 0.3–9.3\% of global gross domestic product. Damages of this magnitude are very unlikely to be tolerated by society and adaptation will be widespread. The global costs of protecting the coast with dikes are significant with annual investment and maintenance costs of US\$ 12–71 billion in 2100, but much smaller than the global cost of avoided damages even without accounting for indirect costs of damage to regional production supply. Flood damages by the end of this century are much more sensitive to the applied protection strategy than to variations in climate and socioeconomic scenarios as well as in physical data sources (topography and climate model). Our results emphasize the central role of long-term coastal adaptation strategies. These should also take into account that protecting large parts of the developed coast increases the risk of catastrophic consequences in the case of defense failure.},

The nonlinear dynamic analyses used a beam-on-nonlinear-Winkler foundation (BNWF) framework to model the soil-pile interaction, nonlinear fiber beam-column elements to model the reinforced concrete sections, and one-dimensional site response analyses for the free-field soil profile response. The study included consideration of ground motion characteristics, site response, lateral soil resistance, structural parameters, geometric nonlinearity (P-Δ effects), and performance measures. Results described herein focus on how the ground motion characteristics and variations in structural configurations affect the performance measures important for evaluating the inelastic seismic response of these structures. Presented results focus on a representative dense soil profile and thus are not widely applicable to dramatically different soil sites.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the description, calibration and application of relatively simple hysteretic models that include strength and stiffness deterioration properties, features that are critical for demand predictions as a structural system approaches collapse. Three of the basic hysteretic models used in seismic demand evaluation are modified to include deterioration properties: bilinear, peak-oriented, and pinching. The modified models include most of the sources of deterioration: i.e. various modes of cyclic deterioration and softening of the post-yielding stiffness, and also account for a residual strength after deterioration. The models incorporate an energy-based deterioration parameter that controls four cyclic deterioration modes: basic strength, post-capping strength, unloading stiffness, and accelerated reloading stiffness deterioration. Calibration of the hysteretic models on steel, plywood, and reinforced-concrete components demonstrates that the proposed models are capable of simulating the main characteristics that influence deterioration. An application of a peak-oriented deterioration model in the seismic evaluation of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems is illustrated. The advantages of using deteriorating hysteretic models for obtaining the response of highly inelastic systems are discussed. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this paper, the authors review existing community resilience metrics and tools, classifying them into one of three main categories: community-level, sector-specific, or sociological. The paper provides short descriptions of each metric and comparisons across metrics within the three main categories and across classes. The authors assess the strengths and limitations of these metrics, discuss challenges in improving community resilience, and provide recommendations for the development of new measures of resilience. The paper concludes with an outlook on the future of community resilience, particularly the need for metrics that apply across hazards, geographic areas, and factors affecting resilience. The authors propose that effective metrics are characterized by: breadth, measures that address community resilience comprehensively; utility, measures that are able to be utilized by the relevant entities to undertake actions to improve resilience; and scientific merit, measures that are scientifically validated through statistical methods, case studies, and fieldwork.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a Parameterized Fragility based Multi Hazard Risk Assessment (PF-MHRA) procedure risk for assessment of a portfolio of highway bridges subjected to earthquake and hurricane events. As a part of this approach, parametric bridge fragility functions are generated for the two hazards, which are an advance over conventional fragility curves as they can be used for bridges with different geometric and structural properties given exposure to different hazard types. The parametric bridge fragility functions are derived using metamodels and stepwise logistic regression with a non-linear logit function. The relative change in hurricane and earthquake fragilities of the bridges is captured by the parametric fragility functions given variation in design details or geometric parameters of the bridges. These fragility functions are combined with regional hazard data to evaluate annual risk, which is measured as the annual probability of damage. For this purpose, hazard input parameters are identified for earthquakes and hurricane events and a new risk assessment procedure for bridges subjected to hurricane wave and surge loading is also developed. Furthermore, coupling of the risk assessment procedure with parameterized fragilities enables a comparative assessment of the contributions of different hazards to the total risk as the bridge details differ in a portfolio. The proposed framework is applied to multi-span simply supported concrete girder bridges located in South Carolina. The application demonstrates the identification and derivation of input models for the multi-hazard risk assessment for earthquakes and hurricane induced storm surge and wave loading. By applying the proposed method, insights are gained on the influence of different bridge geometries and hazard exposure conditions to the risk of bridge damage. The potential of the proposed procedure to serve as an aid to risk based design of bridges is also highlighted.},

  abstract = {Despite many advances in the area of wind effects on structures in recent decades, research has been traditionally conducted within limited resources scattered geographically. With the trend toward increasingly complex designs of civil infrastructure combined with the escalating potential for losses by extreme wind events, a new culture of research needs to be established based on innovative and collaborative solutions for better management of the impact of extreme wind events. To address this change, this paper presents a new paradigm of a multi-scale cyber based laboratory framework for the analysis/design, modeling and simulation of wind load effects based on an ongoing collaborative cyberinfrastructure based platform, VORTEX-Winds: Virtual Organization for Reducing the Toll of EXtreme Winds (https://vortex-winds.org), and discusses its current status since its inception in 2007 and ongoing developments. This collaborative framework as it evolves would enable a paradigm shift by offering advanced cyber-enabled modules (e-modules) for accelerating advances in research and education to achieve improved understanding and better modeling of wind effects on structures. Accordingly, it will enhance wind community’s analysis and design capabilities to address next generation challenges posed by wind. Through empowering those without computational or experimental resources, the e-modules will encompass a large set of subject areas and topics categorized as Database-enabled design, Full-scale/Field site data repository, Statistical/Stochastic toolboxes, Tele-experimentation, Uncertainty modeling, Damage assessment, and Computational platforms. This prototype will allow access to the individual e-module, while it is envisaged that next level of development in VORTEX-Winds will have the capability for an automated and integrated analysis/design through a nexus of e-modules. A highlight of the e-modules currently completed or in development is presented not only to show the efficacy of the framework to enhance and supplement the limitation of traditional off-line approaches, but also to describe architecture and features of e-modules to promote additional cyber-enabled data-driven developments in the field.},

  abstract = {This study assesses the 3D amplification effects in shallow basins and quantifies the effects of site-city interaction (SCI) on high-rise buildings. A regional-scale 3D spectral element simulation is conducted on the Tuen Mun-Yuen Long basin, which contains multiple subbasins with heterogeneous and nonlinear soil profiles, while 3D city models with various building layouts are fully integrated into the basin model for our SCI study. We found a good correlation between spectral amplification factors and soil depths. Site response is significantly amplified at basin edges and centers due to surface waves generated at basin edges and the focusing effects stemming from 3D basin geometry. Transfer functions of 3D basins can be up to fourfold at fundamental frequencies as compared to 1D response, and further amplifications occur at high frequencies due to surface waves. In the SCI simulations, we observe wave trapping in the open space amid buildings resulting in energy concentration and up to twofold PGA amplifications. The wave trapping effect diminishes as the space between buildings increase beyond their range of influence (∼100 m). The SCI analyses show that destructive kinetic energy in superstructures increases 28\% in one horizontal direction but decreases 22\% in the other. Our study concluded that, 1D site response analysis can significantly underestimate the seismic demand in shallow basins. Site-city interaction of high-rise buildings increases the short-period spectra of ground motions, leading to an increase in their story accelerations by up to 50\% and to a substantial decrease in the seismic safety of short structures in their vicinity.},

  abstract = {This paper provides background and historical perspective on the development of the earthquake loss estimation methods of the HAZUS technology (referred to as HAZUS Earthquake), describes the various modules of HAZUS Earthquake, and summarizes the key concepts of these methods. HAZUS Earthquake modules calculate seismic hazard, evaluate the likelihood of various states of damage to buildings, lifelines, and other components of the built environment, and estimate both direct and indirect losses resulting from this damage. The focus of this paper is on building-related methods. The paper also describes two recent improvements to the HAZUS Earthquake technology: (1) the Advanced Engineering Building Module (AEBM) and (2) use of ShakeMap ground motion data. The AEBM allows expert users to develop “building-specific” damage and loss functions. ShakeMap ground motion data HAZUS may be used to rapidly assess potential damage and loss immediately following an earthquake. The paper closes with a comparison of damage and loss estimated using ShakeMap data with actual damage and loss due to the 1994 Northridge earthquake.},

  abstract = {Large-scale landslides along the Kubusu and Besso rivers in Toyama Prefecture are developed in the Miocene Iwaine Formation, which is composed of andesitic lava, tuff, and tuff breccia. In the middle member of this formation, the tuff is easily altered to montmorillonite-bearing rock, and subsequently plays an important role in the development of landslides events, which tend to be large-scale events, as the massive lava of the upper member forms a cap rock over the tuff. The Kiritani and Koinami basins, which are flat intermontane basins located along the Kubusu and Besso rivers, respectively, are interpreted as landslide-dammed lakes, later filled with sediment. Accelerator mass spectrometry 14C ages show that the landslides forming each dam occurred simultaneously, at approximately 2500 BP. These ages were measured from wood fragments embedded in the landslide material of Kiritani, and from an in situ stump drowned during the impoundment of Koinami. If the trigger of these landslides was an earthquake, it is most likely to have been the penultimate event along the Atotsugawa fault zone.},

  abstract = {Bridge design should take into account not only safety and functionality, but also the cost effectiveness of investments throughout a bridge life-cycle. This paper presents a probabilistic approach to compute the life-cycle cost (LCC) of corroding reinforced concrete (RC) bridges in earthquake-prone regions. The approach is developed by combining cumulative seismic damage and damage associated with corrosion due to environmental conditions. Cumulative seismic damage is obtained from a low-cycle fatigue analysis. Chloride-induced corrosion of steel reinforcement is computed based on Fick's second law of diffusion. The proposed methodology accounts for the uncertainties in the ground motion parameters, the distance from the source, the seismic demand on the bridge, and the corrosion initiation time. The statistics of the accumulated damage and the cost of repairs throughout the bridge life-cycle are obtained by Monte-Carlo simulation. As an illustration of the proposed approach, the effects of design parameters on the LCC of an example RC bridge are studied. The results are valuable in better estimating the condition of existing bridges and, therefore, can help to schedule inspection and maintenance programs. In addition, by taking into consideration the two deterioration processes over a bridge life-cycle, it is possible to estimate the optimal design parameters by minimizing, for example, the expected cost throughout the life of the structure. A comparison between the effects of the two deterioration processes shows that, in seismic regions, the cumulative seismic damage affects the reliability of bridges over time more than the corrosion even for corrosive environments.

  abstract = {Much research has been conducted for physics-based ground-motion simulation to reproduce seismic response of soil and structures precisely and to mitigate damages caused by earthquakes. We aimed at enabling physics-based ground-motion simulations of complex three-dimensional (3D) models with multiple materials, such as a digital twin (high-fidelity 3D model of the physical world that is constructed in cyberspace). To perform one case of such simulation requires high computational cost and it is necessary to perform a number of simulations for the estimation of parameters or consideration of the uncertainty of underground soil structure data. To overcome this problem, we proposed a fast simulation method using graphics processing unit computing that enables a simulation with small computational resources. We developed a finite-element-based method for large-scale 3D seismic response analysis with small programming effort and high maintainability by using OpenACC, a directive-based parallel programming model. A lower precision variable format was introduced to achieve further speeding up of the simulation. For an example usage of the developed method, we applied the developed method to soil liquefaction analysis and conducted two sets of simulations that compared the effect of countermeasures against soil liquefaction: grid-form ground improvement to strengthen the earthquake resistance of existing houses and replacement of liquefiable backfill soil of river wharves for seismic reinforcement of the wharf structure. The developed method accelerates the simulation and enables us to quantitatively estimate the effect of countermeasures using the high-fidelity 3D soil-structure models on a small cluster of computers.},

  abstract = {Seismic fragility analysis is considered nowadays as a very efficient computational tool for determining the structural behaviour over a range of seismic intensity levels. There are two approaches for developing fragility curves, either based on the assumption that the structural response follows the lognormal distribution or using reliability analysis techniques for calculating the probability of exceedance for various damage states for a variety of seismic hazard levels. The Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique is regarded as the most consistent reliability analysis method having no limitations regarding its applicability range. However, the required computational effort is the only limitation which increases substantially when implemented for calculating lower probabilities. Incorporating artificial neural networks (ANN) into the fragility analysis framework enhances the computational efficiency of MCS, since ANN require a fraction of time compared to the conventional procedure. In this work two types of ANN are implemented into a MCS-based vulnerability analysis framework of geostructures, where the randomness of material properties, geometry and of the pseudostatically imposed seismic loading is considered.},

To enable comparisons between the test results, a calibrated model of the single pile (1.8\% reinforcement) was developed and used to simulate the response of a single shaft with 1\% reinforcement. Additional simulations of the pile group were performed to evaluate the effects of cap rotation on group response. By comparing the simulated responses for common conditions, i.e., 1\% reinforcing ratio and zero head rotation, group efficiencies were found to range from unity at lateral displacements {$<$}0.004×d{$<$}0.004×d{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mo{$>\&$}lt;{$<$}/mo{$><$}mn{$>$}0.004{$<$}/mn{$><$}mo{$>$}×{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi{$>$}d{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} to 0.8 at small displacements ∼0.01–0.02×d∼0.01–0.02×d{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mo{$>$}∼{$<$}/mo{$><$}mn{$>$}0.01{$<$}/mn{$><$}mo{$>$}–{$<$}/mo{$><$}mn{$>$}0.02{$<$}/mn{$><$}mo{$>$}×{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi{$>$}d{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} and up to 0.9 at failure (displacements {$>$}0.04×d{$>$}0.04×d{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mo{$>\&$}gt;{$<$}/mo{$><$}mn{$>$}0.04{$<$}/mn{$><$}mo{$>$}×{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi{$>$}d{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}). Hence, we find that group efficiency depends on the level of nonlinearity in the foundation system.

The proposed model provides a simple representation of the primary inelastic mechanisms that determine joint behavior: Failure of the joint core under shear loading and anchorage failure of beam and column longitudinal reinforcement embedded in the joint. The model is implemented as a four-node 12-degree-of-freedom element that is appropriate for use with typical hysteretic beam-column line elements in two-dimensional nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete structures. Constitutive relationships are developed to define the load-deformation response of the joint model on the basis of material, geometric, and design parameters. Comparison of simulated and observed response for a series of joint subassemblages with different design details indicates that the proposed model is appropriate for use in simulating response under earthquake loading.},

Nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli fiber-section beam elements are used to represent steel and concrete in the vertical direction, and nonlinear trusses are used to represent the steel and concrete in the horizontal direction and the concrete in the diagonal directions. The model represents the effects of flexure-shear interaction by computing the stress and strains in the horizontal and vertical directions and by considering biaxial effects on the behavior of concrete diagonals and accounts for mesh-size effects. The model is validated by comparing the experimentally measured and numerically computed response of three reinforced concrete T-shape, C-shape, and I-shape section wall specimens, respectively, with the response of the latter two characterized by crushing of the concrete in the diagonal direction. The overall force-deformation and local strain responses are presented. Finally, the computed response using the model developed here is compared with the Euler-Bernoulli fiber-section beam models.},

  abstract = {Engineers often use simplified seismic slope displacement procedures to evaluate the seismic performance of earth structures and natural slopes. Current state of practice procedures typically separate the estimation of the ground motion intensity measure (IM) from the estimate of seismic displacement (D), given the selected IM hazard level. Thus D is estimated based on a single IM value. A straightforward performance-based seismic slope assessment procedure is proposed, which considers the full range of potential IM values to estimate seismic slope displacements directly related to a hazard level. Seismic performance is assessed through either a Newmark-type seismic displacement estimate or a calibrated seismic coefficient that can be used in pseudostatic slope stability analyses. The procedures were developed for a wide range of earth systems for shallow crustal earthquakes and subduction zone earthquakes. Currently employed simplified slope displacement procedures do not provide consistent assessments of the actual seismic slope displacement hazard. The proposed procedures can be readily used in practice to perform rigorous performance-based seismic slope displacement hazard assessments.},

  abstract = {One of the major issues associated with structures located in the tsunami inundation zone is impact of massive objects carried by the tsunami flow. Characterization of forces and assessment of damage to structures due to such impact loads are vital for the design of buildings used for tsunami evacuation purposes and other important structures located in inundation zones. In the present study, numerical investigation of reinforced concrete (RC) columns impacted by shipping containers dispersed by a tsunami is carried out. Two types of general purpose standard shipping containers which are widely used for maritime freight transport impacting on RC columns with square and circular sections are considered, using high-fidelity finite element models. A series of container-column impact analyses is carried out, and damage to the column is evaluated by means of a damage index characterized by degradation of axial load carrying capacity. This study shows that columns in low-rise RC buildings located in tsunami inundation zones can be severely damaged due to dispersed shipping containers. The peak impact force obtained in this study is used to propose equations for impact duration and effective contact stiffness that could be useful when revising existing design guidelines.},

The concrete section may contain any general type of confining steel: either spiral or circular hoops; or rectangular hoops with or without supplementary cross ties. These cross ties can have either equal or unequal confining stresses along each of the transverse axes. A single equation is used for the stress‐strain equation. The model allows for cyclic loading and includes the effect of strain rate. The influence of various types of confinement is taken into account by defining an effective lateral confining stress, which is dependent on the configuration of the transverse and longitudinal reinforcement. An energy balance approach is used to predict the longitudinal compressive strain in the concrete corresponding to first fracture of the transverse reinforcement by equating the strain energy capacity of the transverse reinforcement to the strain energy stored in the concrete as a result of the confinement.},

  abstract = {SummaryIn many parts of the world, earthquakes threaten regional infrastructure systems. For modeling risk using stochastic earthquake catalogs, random variables include rupture location and the damage state of different components. Thus, there is an infinite set of possible damage maps that a risk modeler could evaluate in an event-based probabilistic loss model. Even a finite but large number of damage maps may not be practical, because many network performance measures are computationally expensive. Here, we show a computationally efficient method for selecting a subset of damage maps, corresponding ground-motion intensity maps, and associated occurrence rates that reasonably estimates the full distribution of the ground-motion intensity and a target performance measure using optimization. The method chooses a subset of maps and associated annual rates of occurrence that minimizes the error in estimating the distribution of a network performance measure as well as the marginal distributions of ground-motion intensity exceedance. The joint distribution of the ground-motion intensity is implicitly included in the objective function of the optimization problem via the network performance measure. We then show how to tune the optimization parameters based on consistency checks related to the network performance measure and the ground-motion hazard. We illustrate the proposed method with a case study of the San Francisco Bay Area road network to estimate the exceedance curve of the average percentage change in morning commute trip time. This work facilitates expanded and risk-consistent studies of the impacts of infrastructure networks on regional seismic risk and resiliency. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Measurement and maximization of network resilience that accounts for both in the context of intermodal freight transport are addressed herein. That is, the problem of measuring a network's maximum resilience level and simultaneously determining the optimal set of preparedness and recovery actions necessary to achieve this level under budget and level-of-service constraints is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program. An exact methodology, employing the integer L-shaped method and Monte Carlo simulation, is proposed for its solution. Optimal allocation of a limited budget between preparedness and recovery activities is explored on an illustrative problem instance involving a network abstraction of a United States rail-based intermodal container network.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the performance of different wave generation and absorption methods in computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based numerical wave tanks (NWTs) is analyzed. The open-source CFD code REEF3D is used, which solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier\&ndash;Stokes (RANS) equations to simulate two-phase flow problems. The water surface is computed with the level set method (LSM), and turbulence is modeled with the k-\&omega; model. The NWT includes different methods to generate and absorb waves: the relaxation method, the Dirichlet-type method and active wave absorption. A sensitivity analysis has been conducted in order to quantify and compare the differences in terms of absorption quality between these methods. A reflection analysis based on an arbitrary number of wave gauges has been adopted to conduct the study. Tests include reflection analysis of linear, second- and fifth-order Stokes waves, solitary waves, cnoidal waves and irregular waves generated in an NWT. Wave breaking over a sloping bed and wave forces on a vertical cylinder are calculated, and the influence of the reflections on the wave breaking location and the wave forces on the cylinder is investigated. In addition, a comparison with another open-source CFD code, OpenFOAM, has been carried out based on published results. Some differences in the calculated quantities depending on the wave generation and absorption method have been observed. The active wave absorption method is seen to be more efficient for long waves, whereas the relaxation method performs better for shorter waves. The relaxation method-based numerical beach generally results in lower reflected waves in the wave tank for most of the cases simulated in this study. The comparably better performance of the relaxation method comes at the cost of larger computational requirements due to the relaxation zones that have to be included in the domain. The reflections in the NWT in REEF3D are generally lower than the published results for reflections using the active wave absorption method in the NWT based on OpenFOAM.},

  abstract = {Research on the influence of tsunamis on bridges has been based almost exclusively on the results of field surveys and of two-dimensional analysis. Although these analyses can provide estimates of forces and moments on the structure, they do not account for three-dimensional (3D) phenomena, such as channelization, or geometric effects, such as bridge skew. Using a 3D computational fluid dynamics approach, this work analyzes the temporal and spatial dynamics of a bore-type tsunami loading on a model bridge and shows how the skew angle of the bridge relative to the incoming wave can affect the loading history. The analyses found that, unlike a bridge without skew, (1) the bore impact forces on the skewed deck do not all occur at the same time; (2) the skewed bridge is subjected to a force perpendicular to its abutments, which could lead to unseating; and (3) the skewed bridge is subjected to pitching and spinning moments. These effects combine to lead to increased horizontal reactions in the substructure components nearest the incoming wave. The vertical reactions were relatively insensitive to skew angle.},

  abstract = {Although aftershocks have the potential to cause severe damage to buildings and threaten life safety, their effect in seismic risk analysis is not explicitly accounted for in modern building design codes, nor in emerging methodologies such as performance-based seismic design. The ultimate objective of this study is to systematically integrate aftershock hazard into performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) through analytical studies with structural degradation models derived from publicly available experimental data. In this paper, the first step is made by introducing a procedure to compute the probability of a mainshock-damaged woodframe building entering different damage states as a result of aftershock. Aftershock fragilities are developed by performing incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) using a sequence of mainshock-aftershock ground motions. To compute the seismic response of the damaged building, IDA is performed using a sequence of mainshocks of different intensity levels combined with random aftershocks. The variation in aftershock fragilities for each of the damage states for several different mainshock intensities is presented. The effect of the mainshock damage is to alter the fragilities and is quantified for the building investigated. It is observed that the fragility curves for collapse risk have a similar shape for the mainshock-aftershock sequences for different levels of mainshock. As well as that there was an unexpected result that, if the building model survives the mainshock, the additional collapse risk because of aftershocks may not be as critical as originally thought for engineered woodframe construction. The effect of aftershocks on damage states appears to be more significant, relatively speaking, than on collapse of low-rise woodframe buildings, indicating that including aftershock hazard on performance-based seismic design will be significant.},

  abstract = {Bridge fragility curves, which express the probability of a bridge reaching a certain damage state for a given ground motion parameter, play an important role in the overall seismic risk assessment of a transportation network. Current analytical methodologies for generating bridge fragility curves do not adequately account for all major contributing bridge components. Studies have shown that for some bridge types, neglecting to account for all of these components can lead to a misrepresentation of the bridges' overall fragilities. In this study, an expanded methodology for the generation of analytical fragility curves for highway bridges is presented. This methodology considers the contribution of the major components of the bridge, such as the columns, bearings and abutments, to its overall bridge system fragility. In particular, this methodology utilizes probability tools to directly estimate the bridge system fragility from the individual component fragilities. This is illustrated using a bridge whose construction and configuration are typical to the Central and Southeastern United States and the results are presented and discussed herein. This study shows that the bridge as a system is more fragile than any one of the individual components. Assuming that the columns represent the entire bridge system can result in errors as large as 50\% at higher damage states. This provides support to the assertion that multiple bridge components should be considered in the development of bridge fragility curves. The findings also show that estimation of the bridge fragilities by their first-order bounds could result in errors of up to 40\%. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Surface fault rupture can be damaging to structures built on or near active faults if the hazard is not addressed properly. Fault-induced angular distortion and lateral ground strain can cause beams to yield and eventually lead to structural collapse. When avoidance is not possible, geotechnical mitigation strategies can be used. These strategies include spreading fault displacement over a large area, causing the structure to respond with rigid-body movement, and diverting the fault rupture around the structure. The effectiveness of these strategies can vary from protecting life safety to preventing significant damage and can be effective for a range of dip-slip fault displacements. Earth fills should be sufficiently thick and ductile to prevent the underlying fault dislocation from developing at the ground surface. Thick RC mat foundations proved to be especially effective in shielding the superstructure from the damaging effects of the underlying ground movements. Although more challenging to implement because they require excellent fault characterization, several fault diversion strategies have also proved effective at protecting structures from fault movement.},

  abstract = {The adoption of performance-based wind engineering (PBWE) is rapidly becoming recognized as a fundamental step to reducing the huge economic losses caused by severe windstorms. This has led to the recent introduction of a number of PBWE frameworks for the assessment of engineered building systems such as high-rise structures. Although these frameworks have resulted in significant progress toward the efficient and effective estimation of performance within a PBWE setting, there is still a significant lack of frameworks that can holistically model the performance of the envelope system of engineered buildings. Recognizing how accurate prediction of losses occurring during severe windstorms, such as hurricanes, cannot be made without detailed modeling of the losses caused by damage to the envelope system, this paper introduces a new PBWE framework that is focused on the performance assessment of the envelope system. The proposed framework is based on integrating a recently proposed building envelope damage model into a conditional stochastic simulation framework in which the directional wind and concurrent rain hazard is explicitly modeled together with the stochastic nature of the local wind pressure. By incorporating loss models, performance estimates are provided in terms of annual exceedance rates of system-level metrics such as repair costs. A full-scale building example is presented to illustrate the practicality of the proposed PBWE framework.},

  abstract = {This article presents the results of a seismic risk assessment of the bridge network in Charleston, South Carolina and the surrounding counties to support emergency planning efforts, and for prioritization of bridge retrofit. This study includes an inventory analysis of the approximately 375 bridges in the Charleston area, and convolution of the seismic hazard with fragility curves analytically derived for classes of bridges common to this part of the country. State-of-the-art bridge fragility curves and replacement cost estimates based on region-specific data are used to obtain economic loss estimates. The distribution of potential bridge damage and economic losses are evaluated for several scenario events in order to aid in the identification of emergency routes and assess areas for investment in retrofit. This article also evaluates the effect of uncertainty on the resulting predicted economic losses. The findings reveal that while the risk assessment is very sensitive to both the assumed fragility curves and damage ratios, the estimate of total expected economic losses is more sensitive to the vast differences in damage ratio models considered.},

To this end, a large-scale (20 km × 20 km) heterogeneous 3D seismic wave propagation model for the Groningen area is constructed, based on the significant bulk of available geological, geophysical, geotechnical, and seismological data. Results of physics-based numerical simulations are validated against the ground motion recordings of the January 8, 2018, ML 3.4 Zeerijp earthquake. Taking advantage of suitable models of slip time functions at the seismic source and of the detailed geophysical model, the numerical simulations are found to reproduce accurately the observed features of ground motions at epicentral distances less than 10 km, in a broad frequency range, up to about 8 Hz. A sensitivity analysis is also addressed to discuss the impact of 3D underground geological features, the stochastic variability of seismic velocities and the frequency dependence of the quality factor. Amongst others, results point out some key features related to 3D seismic wave propagation, such as the magnitude and distance dependence of site amplification functions, that may be relevant to the improvement of the empirical models for earthquake ground motion prediction.},

  abstract = {Populations in United States coastal regions have been steadily increasing over time. With this increased populous comes increased exposure to natural hazards, such as hurricanes, with the resulting coastal inundation and tsunamis. During the past two decades, several notable hurricanes have made landfall along the Gulf Coast of the United States, resulting in billions of dollars in damage and loss of human life. This paper presents the method and results of a study that focused on developing a mechanistic assembly based vulnerability (ABV) procedure that combines structural and nonstructural damage vulnerabilities to quantify damage to residential structures as a result of hurricanes. An example is presented that numerically computes the probability of loss for various surge (flood) levels, rainfall intensities, and wind velocities. The methodology presented in this paper will help enable designers and/or planners to assess the change in anticipated losses as a result of one or more mitigation strategies. It is envisioned that this method can integrate directly into performance-based design of wood-frame buildings dyring hurricanes by providing a loss analysis and estimation framework.},

  abstract = {Interior damage is a significant portion of overall building damage caused by hurricanes. Most of the vulnerability models in the literature assess interior damage by expert opinion or with empirical functions of the envelope damage. Interior damage to buildings at low to moderate wind speeds is mainly caused by the ingress of water through breaches in the building's envelope. The parameters that govern water intrusion include wind speed, rain rate, rain duration, raindrop size distributions, exterior building damage, and shape of the building. The amount of ingressed water is proportional to the breach sizes as well as the uncertain meteorological phenomena. This paper presents a novel approach to estimate the interior building damage caused by hurricanes by simulating the co-occurrence of wind, rain and envelope damage and by converting ingressed water into interior damage. The simulation rationale is described and some preliminary qualitative results are introduced via a sample case. The approach presented herein has been implemented in the Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model (FPHLM).},

  abstract = {At present, the seismic vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings is made considering fixed base conditions; moreover, the mechanical properties of the building remain intact in time. In this study we investigate whether these two fundamental hypotheses are sound as aging and soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects might play a crucial role in the seismic fragility analysis of RC structures. Among the various aging processes, we consider the chloride-induced corrosion based on probabilistic modeling of corrosion initiation time and corrosion rate. Different corrosion aspects are considered in the analysis including the loss of reinforcement cross-sectional area, the degradation of concrete cover and the reduction of steel ultimate deformation. SSI is modeled by applying the direct one-step approach, which accounts simultaneously for inertial and kinematic interactions. Two-dimensional incremental dynamic analysis is performed to assess the seismic performance of the initial uncorroded (\$\$\textbackslash hbox \{t\}=0\$\$t=0years) and corroded (\$\$\textbackslash hbox \{t\}=50\$\$t=50years) RC moment resisting frame structures, having been designed with different seismic code levels. The time-dependent fragility functions are derived in terms of the spectral acceleration at the fundamental mode of the structure \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{S\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{a\}\}(\textbackslash hbox \{T\}\_\{1\}\$\$Sa(T1, 5~\%) and the outcropping peak ground acceleration for the immediate occupancy and collapse prevention limit states. Results show an overall increase in seismic vulnerability over time due to corrosion highlighting the important influence of deterioration due to aging effects on the structural behavior. Moreover, the consideration of SSI and site effects may significantly alter the expected structural performance leading to higher vulnerability values.},

  abstract = {Sliding block displacements are used to evaluate the potential for seismic slope instability. Deterministic approaches are typically used to predict the expected level of sliding block displacement, although they do not rigorously account for uncertainties in the expected ground shaking, dynamic response, or displacement prediction. As a result, there is no concept of the actual hazard associated with the displacement computed by the deterministic approach. This paper summarizes and extends recent developments related to the probabilistic assessment of sliding block displacements. The probabilistic approach generates a hazard curve for displacement in which the annual rate of exceedance for a range of displacement levels is computed. The probabilistic approach is formulated both in terms of scalar hazard analysis (i.e., using one ground motion parameter, peak ground acceleration) and vector hazard analysis (i.e., using two ground motion parameters, peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity), and applied both to rigid and flexible sliding block conditions. Generally, the vector probabilistic approach predicts displacements that are 2–3 times smaller than the scalar probabilistic approach, revealing the value of characterizing frequency content via peak ground velocity. Comparisons between the deterministic and probabilistic approaches, in either a scalar or vector context, indicate that the deterministic approach can severely underestimate displacements relative to the probabilistic approach because it ignores the aleatory variabilities in the dynamic and sliding responses of the sliding mass. This under-prediction is most significant for longer period sliding masses. Modifications to the deterministic approach are proposed that provide displacements that are more consistent with the probabilistic approach.},

  abstract = {A method for generating an ensemble of orthogonal horizontal ground motion components with correlated parameters for specified earthquake and site characteristics is presented. The method employs a parameterized stochastic model that is based on a time-modulated filtered white-noise process with the filter having time-varying characteristics. Whereas the input white-noise excitation describes the stochastic nature of the ground motion, the forms of the modulating function and the filter and their parameters characterize the evolutionary intensity and nonstationary frequency content of the ground motion. The stochastic model is fitted to a database of recorded horizontal ground motion component pairs that are rotated into their principal axes, a set of orthogonal axes along which the components are statistically uncorrelated. Model parameters are identified for each ground motion component in the database. Using these data, predictive equations are developed for the model parameters in terms of earthquake and site characteristics and correlation coefficients between parameters of the two components are estimated. Given a design scenario specified in terms of earthquake and site characteristics, the results of this study allow one to generate realizations of correlated model parameters and use them along with simulated white-noise processes to generate synthetic pairs of horizontal ground motion components along the principal axes. The proposed simulation method does not require any seed recorded ground motion and is ideal for use in performance-based earthquake engineering. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Available information concerning the field performance of dams during earthquakes is reviewed and conclusions are drawn concerning the potential for earthquake-induced sliding for different types of construction materials and earthquake shaking intensities. Finally, available methods for evaluating the stability and deformations of the slopes of a dam due to earthquake shaking are reviewed and their applicability illustrated. Conclusions are drawn concerning the significance of the type of soil used for construction and the possibility of delayed failure, after the earthquake ground motions have stopped, due to pore water pressure re-distribution within an embankment. Suggestions are made concerning the appropriate role of analytical procedures in the overall assessment of the seismic stability of dams in relation to the uncertainties involved in the analysis procedures. L'article traite des facteurs à prendre en considération lors de la conception parasismique de barrages et résume les mesures de protection qui peuvent étre prises en vue d'atténuer les effets de ces facteurs. On y trouvera un examen des données disponibles relatives au comportement in situ de barrages au tours de séismes ainsi que les conclusions sur le glissement susceptible de se produire par suite de séismes dans le cas de différents types de matériaux de construction et pour des secousses sismiques d'intensités différentes.

  abstract = {We present deterministic ground motion simulations that account for the cyclic multiaxial response of sediments in the shallow crust. We use the Garner Valley in Southern California as a test case. The multiaxial constitutive model is based on the bounding surface plasticity theory in terms of total stress and is implemented in a high-performance computing finite-element parallel code. A major advantage of this model is the small number of free parameters that need to be calibrated given a shear modulus reduction curve and the ultimate soil strength. This, in turn, makes the model suitable for regional-scale simulations, where geotechnical data in the shallow crust are scarce. In this paper, we first describe a series of numerical experiments designed to verify the model implementation. This is followed by a series of idealized large-scale simulations in a 35 26 4.5 km domain that encompasses the Garner Valley downhole array site, which is an instrumented and well-characterized site in Southern California. Material properties were extracted from the Southern California Earthquake Center Community velocity model, CVM-S4.26, considering its optional geotechnical layer, while the modulus reduction curves and soil strength were selected empirically to constrain the nonlinear soil model parameters. Our nonlinear simulations suggest that peak ground displacements within the valley increase relative to the linear case, while peak ground accelerations can increase or decrease, depending on the frequency content of the excitation. The comparisons of our simulations against hybrid three-dimensional–one-dimensional site response analyses suggest the inadequacy of the latter to capture the complexity of fully three-dimensional simulations.},

Several global and local nonlinear damage measures are considered. A five-DOF model of a steel structure is used; other cases are under study. The paper finishes with a demonstration of the use of such results in the estimation of the annual probability of exceeding a specified interstory ductility (drift) or other damage measures.},

The most commonly used structural type in highway construction is the integral precast multi-girder bridge. These bridges are typically constructed as continuous multi-support systems with monolithic joints at each support, thus their behavior may be significantly different from those applying simply supported beams and conventional bearings. A parametric fragility analysis of a wide range of different layouts is carried out using detailed and advanced non-linear numerical models. The results indicate that the abutment joints are highly vulnerable and piers are also critical for longer bridges. The study implies that without seismic design, integral precast multi-girder bridges are highly susceptible to pier shear failure, the probability of collapse is relatively high. The results also provide a solid basis for retrofit planning as well as for development of design concepts of newly built structures in moderate seismic zones.},

  abstract = {The principal focus of this study is the development of a robust macroelement model for soil–pile interaction under cyclic loads. The model incorporates frictional forces and formation of gaps at the soil–pile interface as well as hysteretic behavior of the soil. The plastic envelope of the soil behavior is modeled via the so-called pp{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>$}p{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}–yy{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>$}y{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} approach, outlined in American Petroleum Institute's guidelines for design of foundation piles for offshore platforms. The macroelement is an intuitive assembly of various basic elements, each of which incorporating a particular aspect of the soil–pile interaction. The modular structure of this macroelement allows straightforward adaptation of improved constitutive models for its building blocks. Herein, we focus on large-diameter, cast-in-drilled-hole reinforced concrete piles (piers) that are partially or fully embedded in soil. These types of piles are frequently used as support structures in highway construction. Consequently, the numerical robustness of the interaction model is assessed with parametric studies on pile systems and soil types relevant to this type of construction. Both elastic and inelastic pile behaviors are considered in the parametric studies. The results indicate that the proposed interaction element is numerically robust, and thus, amenable to routine structural analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper tackles the challenging problem of constrained hexahedral meshing. An algorithm is introduced to build combinatorial hexahedral meshes whose boundary facets exactly match a given quadrangulation of the topological sphere. This algorithm is the first practical solution to the problem. It is able to compute small hexahedral meshes of quadrangulations for which the previously known best solutions could only be built by hand or contained thousands of hexahedra. These challenging quadrangulations include the boundaries of transition templates that are critical for the success of general hexahedral meshing algorithms. The algorithm proposed in this paper is dedicated to building combinatorial hexahedral meshes of small quadrangulations and ignores the geometrical problem. The key idea of the method is to exploit the equivalence between quad flips in the boundary and the insertion of hexahedra glued to this boundary. The tree of all sequences of flipping operations is explored, searching for a path that transforms the input quadrangulation Q into a new quadrangulation for which a hexahedral mesh is known. When a small hexahedral mesh exists, a sequence transforming Q into the boundary of a cube is found; otherwise, a set of pre-computed hexahedral meshes is used. A novel approach to deal with the large number of problem symmetries is proposed. Combined with an efficient backtracking search, it allows small shellable hexahedral meshes to be found for all even quadrangulations with up to 20 quadrangles. All 54, 943 such quadrangulations were meshed using no more than 72 hexahedra. This algorithm is also used to find a construction to fill arbitrary domains, thereby proving that any ball-shaped domain bounded by n quadrangles can be meshed with no more than 78 n hexahedra. This very significantly lowers the previous upper bound of 5396 n.},

These models represent the last two of five major component models used in HAZUS for the prediction of damage and loss to buildings subjected to hurricanes. The damage and loss models have been validated using damage data collected during poststorm damage surveys and insurance loss data. The HAZUS Hurricane Model represents an advance in the state of the art over most hurricane loss prediction models, in that it estimates wind induced loads, building response, damage, and then loss, rather than simply using historical loss data to model loss as a function of wind speed. A mitigation example is presented that shows the expected reductions in losses achieved by strengthening the roof of a building and adding window protection.},

It is widely used in engineering and geophysics fields to assess and predict the likelihood of various outcomes. This paper describes a UQ platform called UQ-PyL (Uncertainty Quantification Python Laboratory), a flexible software platform designed to quantify uncertainty of complex dynamical models. UQ-PyL integrates different kinds of UQ methods, including experimental design, statistical analysis, sensitivity analysis, surrogate modeling and parameter optimization. It is written in Python language and runs on all common operating systems. UQ-PyL has a graphical user interface that allows users to enter commands via pull-down menus. It is equipped with a model driver generator that allows any computer model to be linked with the software. We illustrate the different functions of UQ-PyL by applying it to the uncertainty analysis of the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model. We will also demonstrate that UQ-PyL can be applied to a wide range of applications.},

  abstract = {To better predict the responses of tall buildings in regional seismic simulation, a nonlinear multiple degree-of-freedom (MDOF) flexural-shear (NMFS) model and its associated parameter calibration method are proposed. The model has such advantages as (1) representation of the nonlinear flexural-shear deformation mode of tall buildings, (2) a high computational efficiency, (3) convenient parameter calibration, and (4) the ability to output the inter-story drift of each story. The characteristics of the nonlinear lateral flexural-shear deformation mode of tall buildings are appropriately considered in the NMFS model. The accuracy of the inter-story drift prediction is far superior to the traditional nonlinear MDOF shear (NMS) model. The computing efficiency is also remarkably improved and the speed-up ratio is greater than 30,000 by comparing to the corresponding refined finite element (FE) model. The parameters of the building models can be conveniently and efficiently calibrated using the widely accessible building attribute data from GIS. More specifically, only the descriptive information (i.e., structural height, year of construction, site condition and structural type) of each building is required to perform such calibration. Two representative tall buildings and a residential area with tall buildings are selected to demonstrate the implementation and advantages of the proposed NMFS model. Outcomes of this work are expected to provide a useful reference for future work on regional seismic loss estimations of tall buildings.},

  abstract = {A new fully automatic hex-dominant mesh generation technique of an arbitrary 3D geometric domain is presented herein. The proposed method generates a high-quality hex-dominant mesh by: (1) controlling the directionality of the output hex-dominant mesh; and (2) avoiding ill-shaped elements induced by nodes located too closely to each other. The proposed method takes a 3D geometric domain as input and creates a hex-dominant mesh consisting mostly of hexahedral elements, with additional prism and tetrahedral elements. Rectangular solid cells are packed on the boundary of and inside the input domain to obtain ideal node locations for a hex-dominant mesh. Each cell has a potential energy field that mimics a body-centred cubic (BCC) structure (seen in natural substances such as NaCl) and the cells are moved to stable positions by a physically based simulation. The simulation mimics the formation of a crystal pattern so that the centres of the cells provide ideal node locations for a hex-dominant mesh. Via the advancing front method, the centres of the packed cells are then connected to form a tetrahedral mesh, and this is converted to a hex-dominant mesh by merging some of the tetrahedrons.

  abstract = {In order to reveal the characteristics of embankment fragility under seismic actions and investigate the influence of retaining walls on embankment seismic fragility, seismic fragility was theoretically evaluated in view of the K1125+470 embankment of Xi'an-Baoji segment in Lianyungang-Huoerguosi expressway. Embankment seismic fragilities were ranked and seismic damage parameters were selected. The corresponding relationship between embankment seismic damage levels and seismic damage parameters as well as the finite-difference models of embankments with and without a retaining wall based on Flac was established. The actual seismic oscillation records were selected for the Incremental Dynamic Analysis, clarifying regularity of seismic damage parameters under the effect of peak ground acceleration with and without a retaining wall. Probability of seismic damage at different grades was investigated on the basis of probabilistic seismic demand analysis and the seismic fragility curves were also mapped. The comparison was made for the seismic fragility assessment results of the embankments with and without a retaining wall. The results show that when peak ground acceleration reaches 1.2g, the probabilities of destruction to the embankments with and without a retaining wall are 16.854\% and 76.679\% higher than the probability with the peak ground acceleration of 1.0g on average, 95.895\% and 88.008\% higher than the probability with the peak ground acceleration of 0.8g on average. Whether the retaining wall exists or not, the greater the peak ground acceleration is, the greater the probabilities of severe embankment seismic damage are. When the transcendental probabilities of destruction damage are 30\%, 50\% and 80\%respectively, ground peak accelerations corresponding to destruction of embankment with a retaining wall are 17.93\%, 18.14\% and 18.34\% respectively higher than those without a retaining wall, namely, under the same seismic actions, the seismic damage status of embankment without a retaining wall is more serious than that with a retaining one, with a positive effect of a retaining wall on embankment seismic performance.},

LSI, a measure of ground failure displacement, is based on the displacement of lateral spreads on gently‐sloping late Holocene fluvial deposits such as floodplains and deltas. By selecting a specific geologic environment, LSI is normalized with respect to site conditions. LSIs are evaluated for several earthquakes in the western United States, and an equation is developed between LSI, earthquake magnitude, and distance from the seismic energy source. This equation and a model of seismic energy sources is used with a published seismic risk algorithm to compile probabilistic LSI maps for southern California. The maps show contours of LSI with 90\% probability of nonexceedance in periods of 10, 50, and 250 years. LSI maps are useful for determining the relative liquefaction hazard and provide an index of possible maximum ground displacement.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we provide two case studies to demonstrate how artificial intelligence can empower civil engineering. In the first case, a machine learning-assisted framework, BRAILS, is proposed for city-scale building information modeling. Building information modeling (BIM) is an efficient way of describing buildings, which is essential to architecture, engineering, and construction. Our proposed framework employs deep learning technique to extract visual information of buildings from satellite/street view images. Further, a novel machine learning (ML)-based statistical tool, SURF, is proposed to discover the spatial patterns in building metadata. The second case focuses on the task of soft-story building classification. Soft-story buildings are a type of buildings prone to collapse during a moderate or severe earthquake. Hence, identifying and retrofitting such buildings is vital in the current earthquake preparedness efforts. For this task, we propose an automated deep learning-based procedure for identifying soft-story buildings from street view images at a regional scale. We also create a large-scale building image database and a semi-automated image labeling approach that effectively annotates new database entries. Through extensive computational experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

It is shown that the shear-wedge model yields realistic estimates for the amplification functions of typical embankments and reveals the appropriate levels of dynamic strains which are subsequently used to estimate the stiffness and damping coefficients of embankments. The shear-wedge model is extended to a two-dimensional model in order to calculate the transverse static stiffness of an approach embankment loaded at one end. The formulation leads to a sound closed-form expression for the critical length, Lc, that is the ratio of the transverse static stiffness of an approach embankment and the transverse static stiffness of a unit-width wedge. It is shown through two case studies that the transverse dynamic stiffness (`spring' and `dashpot') of the approach embankment can be estimated with confidence by multiplying the dynamic stiffness of the unit-width wedge with the critical length, Lc. The paper concludes that the values obtained for the transverse kinematic response function and dynamic stiffness can also be used with confidence to represent the longitudinal kinematic response function and dynamic stiffness, respectively.},

This paper investigates the effects and potential of aftershocks on the accumulated damage of concrete gravity dams. For that purpose, 30 as-recorded mainshock–aftershock seismic sequences are considered in this study, and a typical two-dimensional gravity dam model subjected to the selected as-recorded seismic sequences is modeled. A Concrete Damaged Plasticity (CDP) model including the strain hardening or softening behavior is selected for the concrete material. This model is used to evaluate the nonlinear dynamic response and the seismic damage process of Koyna dam under mainshock–aftershock seismic sequences. According to the characteristics of the cracking damage development, the local and global damage indices are both established to study the influence of strong aftershocks on the cumulative damage of concrete gravity dams. From the results of this investigation, it is found that the as-recorded sequences of ground motions have a significant effect on the accumulated damage and on the design of concrete gravity dams.},

This building was typical of many medium rise reinforced concrete bearing wall buildings designed and built in Chile during the period 1996?2009. Understanding the mechanism that led to the collapse of the Alto Rio building is of high relevance in the earthquake engineering community. For this purpose, a detailed three-dimensional nonlinear model of the as-built Alto Rio building structure was developed in the OpenSees analysis framework using the beam-truss modeling approach. The geometry of the structure was obtained directly from the architectural blueprints. Realistic cyclic material constitutive models were used for the reinforcing steel and concrete materials. This paper describes in detail the development of the building model. Furthermore, it presents the results obtained from a nonlinear pushover analysis and from a nonlinear time-history analysis using a bi-axial horizontal input ground motion generated by blending time-history ground accelerations recorded at an accelerograph station located 1.2~km from the building and time-history ground displacements recorded at a GPS station located 3.7~km from the building.},

  abstract = {Scenario-based earthquake simulations at regional scales hold the promise in advancing the state-of-the-art in seismic risk assessment studies. In this study, a computational workflow is presented that combines (i) a broadband Green's function-based fault-rupture and ground motion simulation—herein carried out using the “UCSB (University of California at Santa Barbara) method”, (ii) a three-dimensional physics-based regional-scale wave propagation simulation that is resolved at Hz, and (iii) a local soil-foundation-structure finite element analysis model. These models are interfaced with each other using the domain reduction method. The innermost local model—implemented in ABAQUS—is additionally enveloped with perfectly matched layer boundaries that absorb outbound waves scattered by the structures contained within it. The intermediate wave propagation simulation is carried out using Hercules, which is an explicit time-stepping finite element code that is developed and licensed by the CMU-QUAKE group. The devised workflow is applied to a km region on the European side of Istanbul, which was modeled using detailed soil stratigraphy data and realistic fault rupture properties, which are available from prior microzonation surveys and earthquake scenario studies. The innermost local model comprises a chevron-braced steel frame building supported by a shallow foundation slab, which, in turn, rests atop a three-dimensional soil domain. To demonstrate the utility of the workflow, results obtained using various simplified soil-structure interaction analysis techniques are compared with those from the detailed direct model. While the aforementioned demonstration has a limited scope, the devised workflow can be used in a multitude of ways, for example, to examine the effects of shallow-layer soil nonlinearities and surface topography, to devise site- and structure-specific seismic fragilities, and for calibrating regional loss models, to name a few.},

Despite the apparent simplicity of global average pooling, we are able to achieve 37.1\% top-5 error for object localization on ILSVRC 2014 without training on any bounding box annotation.

  abstract = {Existing residential wood frame structures account for a significant portion of the seismic vulnerability of a geographic region, as earthquake-induced damages can lead to loss of housing and broad disruption to communities. In probabilistic seismic performance assessment, the standard method of using nonlinear response history analysis to estimate the seismic response of a structure presents a high computational cost which limits the scale of regional-level earthquake simulations. This study presents a surrogate model-based solution for the efficient seismic response estimation of residential wood frame structures for applications in regional seismic performance assessment. Kriging is adopted as the framework for developing an approximate functional relationship between input parameters representing properties of the structural model and ground motion excitation and corresponding output parameters providing measures of collapse fragility, median seismic response, and prediction variance. An initial set of surrogate models are formulated for a case study building to evaluate the accuracy of the kriging metamodel prediction and illustrate the influence of structural properties on the seismic vulnerability of residential wood frame structures.}
